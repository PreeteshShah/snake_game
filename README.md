# snake_game
 snake game with audio. Made in Python 3
 Learned A LOT about libraries here and it was really fun to play around with various types of data structures and basic loops
 Learning Pycharm was also great. 
 There is some lag when the apple is being eaten, have never been really able to figure out why.
 Let me know if someone knows!
